                    As the UI Visual designer for this project, I was
                    responsible for the UI design and prototyping. My tasks
                    included creating high-fidelity UI designs, building UI
                    system, and ensuring the platform was intuitive and
                    efficient for government staff. After designs were
                    finalized, I handed them off to the developers and oversaw
                    the delivery to ensure smooth implementation.

                      understand the issues. Each week, the platform

                      content of the report. This ensures that staff can quickly

                Designing a system from 0 to 1 was a new challenge for me.
                During this time, I was also responsible for two other projects,
                so balancing priorities and handing off designs remotely to
                external engineers was challenging.
                <br />
                I’m thankful to the project manager for their clear guidance and
                to the engineers for their support.
